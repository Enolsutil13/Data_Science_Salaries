# Data Science Salaries

In this project we are going to analyze a dataset with data science salaries for 2023. For this we will use Python and its different graph creation libraries.

You will need the following python libraries:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly as px
import plotly.express as px
import math

Although I personally like interactive graphics, feel free to experiment with the different libraries that Python has.


This small project can give you a vision of the salary situation in our sector during 2023, I invite you to investigate and experiment with this data as much as you want.
